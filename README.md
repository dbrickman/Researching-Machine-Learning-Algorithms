# Researching-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

This is my groups repository for Researching Machine Learning Algorithms and Implementing a New Model Exercises as part of the Dev10 Data Programming curriculum.
## Navigation
- Researching Machine Learning Algorithms.pptx is a presentation that introduces the basics of the supervised, classification machine learning algorithm: Naive Bayes. 

- Cars93.csv is the cars dataset that is used for machine learning algorithms

- LinearRegression-vs-RandomForest.ipynb is the Jupyter notebook that conducts a multiple linear regression and random forest regression from the Cars93.csv dataset

- Random Forest Coding.pdf is a presentation that compares the Random Forest Regression with the Multiple Linear Regression from the Cars93.csv dataset.
